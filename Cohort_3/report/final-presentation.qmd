Future iterations will incorporate such queries to gauge participant willingness to apply HCD methods and skills in their work after the program ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limitations

::: callout-warning
## Key Takeaway

The analysis, while supported by survey sampling weights, comes with inherent limitations. While these weights and other statistical techniques help make the sample more reflective of the broader population, it's important to note that they cannot entirely compensate for all the limitations inherent in the data.

To interpret the findings within the context of these methodological constraints, qualitative data from interviews provide the nuances of uncovering participant experiences.

We strive for transparency and rigor, ensuring stakeholders are fully informed about the strengths and constraints of the findings.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Survey design data collection challenges:** The pre- and post-test surveys had question design errors which contributed to bias. Thus, the evaluation relied on descriptive data analysis and interviews for identifying trends and themes. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses provided insights into changes in participants' experiences and perceptions.

-   **Survey distribution and sample representation:** Incomplete or varying methods of survey distribution may have impacted the representativeness of results. Application of survey design weights attempted to correct for potential biases in sample size and results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Challenges in data analysis:** Presence of a single primary sampling unit (PSU) in post-test data limited variance calculation. Alternatives like bootstrapping or jackknife methods were not used for causal inference due to it not being able to correct for existing bias in data collection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Comparison of pre-test and post-test data:** Pre-test and post-test surveys are conceptually aligned but differed in both questions and scales: a 4-point Likert scale for pre-test (focusing on agreement) and a 5-point scale for post-test (assessing expertise levels). Shifts in response distributions were analyzed using non-parametric methods, focusing on overall trends with descriptive statistics to compare before and after without inferring statistical significance. They are not directly comparable, which means means a direct comparison or change analysis like a t-test is not straightforward.

::: notes
In our analysis of the survey data, we have applied survey sampling weights to adjust for disparities in response rates and representation across different city government groups. While these weights help in making our sample more reflective of the broader population, it's important to note that they cannot entirely compensate for all the limitations inherent in the data. Specifically, the non-random nature of our sampling method and the presence of biases in sample collection present challenges that weights alone may not fully address. As a result, while the weighted analysis offers valuable insights, the findings should be interpreted with an understanding of these constraints. We remain committed to transparency and rigor in our research and want to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the nuances and limitations of the methods employed.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Nonresponse and uneven survey uptake across cities:** Response rates varied notably, with about 15 responses for the pre-test and 13 for the post-test. Uneven distribution of responses across cities, such as only one pre-test response from a specific city, complicated the analysis.

-   **Participant drop offs and inconsistent engagement:** Role or organizational changes among participants led to data gaps, as those no longer in the program couldn't provide follow-up information.
